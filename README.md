# XamarinFormsTravelApp
A basic Xamarin Forms app I built whilst I was leaning the basics

1. You will need to download Visula Studio.
2. After the installer is installed, you need to choose to customize the installation by selecting the feature set or workloads that we want. 
3. Select the Mobile Development with .NET workload from the installation screen then you should be good to go.
